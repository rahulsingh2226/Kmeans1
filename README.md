KMeans Driver Clustering
This repository contains the notebook KMeans_Driver.ipynb, which applies K-Means clustering to analyze driver behavior and segment drivers into distinct groups based on key attributes.

📘 Overview
The notebook performs the following tasks:

Loads and preprocesses driver-related data

Applies K-Means clustering algorithm

Determines the optimal number of clusters (possibly using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score)

Visualizes clusters and interprets driver segments

This project is useful for understanding how to apply unsupervised learning to real-world business problems like fleet management, driver performance analysis, or behavior-based segmentation.
